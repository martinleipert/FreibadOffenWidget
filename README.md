# Pool Status Widget

By Martin Leipert

Written for the public swimming pool in Graefenberg,  Franconia, Germany. 
Displays the water temperature, opening hours and the status. 
Status can be determined automatically or set manually in the backend. 

## Problem Statement

The public swimming pool in Gr√§fenberg is open from Mai to September when the weather is good, e.g. temperature about 19 degree Celsius, no intense rain. 
At hot days, its obvious that the pool is opened. 
Yet in edge cases, visitors are oftentimes insecure if the swimming pool is actually open or closed and oftentimes call the staff.
To provide information about opening status and the current water temperature, this widget was written.
